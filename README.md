# RustBsq

Reproducing a C school project in Rust. In order to familiarise myself with Rust

The program works and is finished.

### What it is doing ?

It's a simple program to train on a new language like the famous todo-list project

It's job is to find the largest square in the file given as parameter and print the same file with the largest square fund with it

#### Exemple:

```bash
$ ~ > cat map1010
10
.o.o...o..
.o..o.o.oo
..o....o..
....o....o
.o...o....
....o.....
..o..o....
.......o..
oo.o......
..o....o..
$ ~ > ./bsq map1010
.o.o...o..
.o..o.o.oo
..o....o..
....o.xxxo
.o...oxxx.
....o.xxx.
..o..o....
.......o..
oo.o......
..o....o..

```
Notice the square of `x` in the print of the bsq program
